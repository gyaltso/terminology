This is a web site scaffold for presenting the data produced by the terminology json export.
The page is designed for a single terminology.
Place the two generated files (terms.html and terms.json) into the folder data replacing the example data.

The web pages use resources from the following projects both of which are available under
the MIT license (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License):

jQuery (license: https://jquery.org/license/, https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/LICENSE.txt)
https://jquery.org/

filter.js (license: https://github.com/jiren/filter.js/blob/master/LICENSE)
https://github.com/jiren/filter.js


Some of the example entries are taken from the Microsoft Language Portal
www.microsoft.com/language/

page/index.html, page/style.css and page/filterjs/termsjs.js are adapted to the Terminology use case 
from the examples provided at https://github.com/jiren/filter.js/tree/master/examples.

filter.js was slightly adapted (lines 1243,1244).
The automatic key event for the search was removed in order to prevent an expensive search while the user is typing.
